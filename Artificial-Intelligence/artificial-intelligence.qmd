# Artificial Intelligence {data-visibility="uncounted"}

## Different goals of AI

Artificial intelligence describes an agent which is capable of:

----------------     -----------------------
Thinking humanly     Thinking rationally
Acting humanly       Acting rationally 
----------------     -----------------------

AI eventually become dominated by one approach, called _machine learning_, which itself is now dominated by _deep learning_ (neural networks).

There are AI algorithms for simple tasks that don't use machine learning though.

> At its core, a pathfinding method searches a graph by starting at one vertex and exploring adjacent nodes until the destination node is reached, generally with the intent of finding the cheapest route. Although graph searching methods such as a breadth-first search would find a route if given enough time, other methods, which "explore" the graph, would tend to reach the destination sooner. An analogy would be a person walking across a room; rather than examining every possible route in advance, the person would generally walk in the direction of the destination and only deviate from the path to avoid an obstruction, and make deviations as minor as possible.

## A neuron 'firing'

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Similar to a biological neuron, an artificial neuron 'fires' when the combined input information exceeds a certain threshold. This activation can be seen as a step function. The difference is that the artificial neuron uses mathematical rules (e.g. weighted sum) to 'fire' whereas 'firing' in the biological neurons is far more complex and dynamic.
:::

```{python}
#| echo: false
import numpy as np

x = [-5, -1e-10, 0, 5]
y = [x_i >= 0 for x_i in x]

plt.plot(x, y)

# Annotate the top-left corner of the plot with the name
# of the activation function
plt.annotate(
    "Step function",
    xy=(0.2, 1),
    xycoords="axes fraction",
    xytext=(-5, -5),
    textcoords="offset points",
    ha="left",
    va="top",
)

plt.xlabel("Input")
plt.ylabel("Output");
```

## An artificial neuron 

![A neuron in a neural network with a ReLU activation.](single-neuron.png)

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The figure shows how we first compute the weighted sum of inputs, and then evaluate the summation using the step function. If the weighted sum is greater than the pre-set threshold, the neuron `fires'.

:::

## One neuron with bias

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"} 
The bias is a constant term added to the product of inputs and weights. It helps in shifting the entire activation function to either the negative or positive side. This shifting can either accelerate or delay the activation. For example, if the bias is negative, it will shift the entire curve to the right, making the activation harder. This is similar to delaying the activation.

## A basic neural network

![A basic fully-connected/dense network.](basic-neural-network.png)

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
This neural network consists of an input layer with 2 neurons ($x_1, x_2$), an output layer with 3 neurons, and 1 hidden layer with 4 neurons. Since every neuron is linked to every other neuron, this is called a fully connected neural network. Since we have 2 inputs and 1 bias in the input layer, each neuron in the hidden layer has 2+1=3 parameters to learn. Similarly, there are 4 neurons and 1 bias in the hidden layer. Hence, each neuron in the output layer has 4+1=5 parameters to learn.

Activation functions are essential for a neural network design. They provide the mathematical rule for 'firing' the neuron. There are many activation functions, and the choice of the activation function depends on the problem we are trying to solve. Note: If we use the 'linear' activation function at every neuron, then the regression learning problem becomes a simple linear regression. But if we use 'ReLu', 'tanh', or any other non-linear function, then, we can introduce non-linearity into the model so that the model can learn complex non-linear patterns in the data. There are activation functions in both the hidden layers and the output layer. The activation function in the hidden layer controls how the neural network learns complex non-linear patterns in the training data. The choice of activation function in the output layer determines the type of predictions we get.

Doesn't mean deep learning is always the best option!

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
A major part of traditional machine learning (TML) involves conducting feature engineering to extract relevant features manually. In contrast, representational learning does not involve heavy manual feature engineering, rather, it learns relevant features automatically from data during the task. Therefore, the effort spent on feature engineering in representational learning is minimal compared to TML.

There are three inputs, hence, three features. There is one neuron in the output layer, hence, one target. There are $3 \times 4 + 4 \times 4 + 4\times 1 = 32$ arrows, hence, there are 32 weights in total. Since there is 1 bias for each neuron, there are 9 biases in total. The number of total parameters to learn equals to the sum of weights and biases, hence, there are $32+9=41$ parameters in total.
