## What is NLP?

A field of research at the intersection of computer science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence that takes the __naturally spoken or written language__ of humans and __processes it with machines__ to automate or help in certain tasks

## How the computer sees text

Spot the odd one out:

```{python}
#| echo: false
print([ord(x) for x in "patrick laub"])
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
print([ord(x) for x in "PATRICK LAUB"])
```
```{python}
#| echo: false
print([ord(x) for x in "Levi Ackerman"])
```

::: fragment
Generated by:
```{python}
#| eval: false
print([ord(x) for x in "patrick laub"])
print([ord(x) for x in "PATRICK LAUB"])
print([ord(x) for x in "Levi Ackerman"])
```

The `ord` built-in turns characters into their ASCII form.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Question

The largest value for a character is 127, can you guess why?

## ASCII

![American Standard Code for Information Interchange](wiki-ASCII-Table-wide.png)

Unicode is the new standard.

## Random strings

The built-in `chr` function turns numbers into characters.

```{python}
rnd.seed(1)
```
```{python}
chars = [chr(rnd.randint(32, 127)) for _ in range(10)]
chars
```

```{python}
" ".join(chars)
```

```{python}
"".join([chr(rnd.randint(32, 127)) for _ in range(50)])
```

```{python}
"".join([chr(rnd.randint(0, 128)) for _ in range(50)])
```


## Escape characters

::: columns
::: column

```{python}
print("Hello,\tworld!")
```

```{python}
print("Line 1\nLine 2")
```

```{python}
#| eval: false
print("Patrick\rLaub")
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
print("Laubick")
```

:::
::: column

```{python}
#| error: true
print("C:\tom\new folder")
```

Escape the backslash:

```{python}
print("C:\\tom\\new folder")
```

```{python}
repr("Hello,\rworld!")
```

## Non-natural language processing I

How would you evaluate

> 10 + 2 * -3

::: {.fragment}
All that Python sees is a string of characters.

```{python}
[ord(c) for c in "10 + 2 * -3"]
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
```{python}
10 + 2 * -3
```
:::

## Non-natural language processing II

Python first tokenizes the string:

```{python}
import tokenize
import io

code = "10 + 2 * -3"
tokens = tokenize.tokenize(io.BytesIO(code.encode("utf-8")).readline)
for token in tokens:
    print(token)
```

## Non-natural language processing III

Python needs to _parse_ the tokens into an abstract syntax tree.

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}

```{python}
import ast

print(ast.dump(ast.parse("10 + 2 * -3"), indent="  "))
```

:::
::: {.column width="30%"}

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
graph TD;
    Expr --> C[Add]
    C --> D[10]
    C --> E[Mult]
    E --> F[2]
    E --> G[USub]
    G --> H[3]

```

:::
:::

## Non-natural language processing IV

The abstract syntax tree is then compiled into bytecode.

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
```{python}
import dis

def expression(a, b, c):
    return a + b * -c

dis.dis(expression)
```
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

## Applications of NLP in Industry

__1) Classifying documents__: Using the language within a body of text to classify it into a particular category, e.g.:

- Grouping emails into high and low urgency
- Movie reviews into positive and negative sentiment (i.e. _sentiment analysis_)
- Company news into bullish (positive) and bearish (negative) statements

__2) Machine translation__: Assisting language translators with machine-generated suggestions from a source language (e.g. English) to a target language

## Applications of NLP in Industry

__3) Search engine__ functions, including:

- Autocomplete
- Predicting what information or website user is seeking

__4) Speech recognition__: Interpreting voice commands to provide information or take action. Used in virtual assistants such as Alexa, Siri, and Cortana

## Deep learning & NLP?

Simple NLP applications such as spell checkers and synonym suggesters __do not require deep learning__ and can be solved with __deterministic, rules-based code__ with a dictionary/thesaurus.

More complex NLP applications such as classifying documents, search engine word prediction, and chatbots are complex enough to be solved using deep learning methods.

## NLP in 1966-1973 #1

>A typical story occurred in early machine translation efforts, which were generously funded by the U.S. National Research Council in an attempt to speed up the translation of Russian scientific papers in the wake of the Sputnik launch in 1957.
> It was thought initially that simple syntactic transformations, based on the grammars of Russian and English, and word replacement from an electronic dictionary, would suffice to preserve the exact meanings of sentences.

## NLP in 1966-1973 #2

> The fact is that accurate translation requires background knowledge in order to resolve ambiguity and establish the content of the sentence.
> The famous retranslation of **“the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak”** as **“the vodka is good but the meat is rotten”** illustrates the difficulties encountered.
> In 1966, a report by an advisory committee found that “there has been no machine translation of general scientific text, and none is in immediate prospect.”
> All U.S. government funding for academic translation projects was canceled.
