## Variational autoencoder

::: {.notes}
A slightly different sample from the distribution in the latent space will be decoded to a slightly different image. The stochasticity of this process improves robustness and forces the latent space to encode meaningful representation everywhere: every point in the latent space is decoded to a valid output. So the latent spaces of VAEs are continuous and highly-structured.
