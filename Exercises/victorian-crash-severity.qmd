<!-- 
TODO Fix up this task after reading the data dictionary / doing a permutation importance.

"E.g. are there any very powerful predictors that your model is using which could hint at an error in the problem construction.""

Your task is to predict whether a specific car crash will be a high severity or a low severity incident.
You will use a dataset of car crashes in Victoria where the police were called to assist.
The dataset is available [here](https://laub.au/ai/data/ACCIDENT.csv) ([original source](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/crash-stats-data-extract)).

![DALL-E's rendition of this Victorian car crash severity classification task.](victorian-crash-severity.jpg)

The network must use entity embedding for at least one of the categorical variables (e.g. the `DCA_CODE`), and train on a mix of both categorical and numerical features.
The target variable is the binary outcome that severity is > 2.
Report on the value of the accuracy of your classifier and give a confusion matrix.

Questions:

- How did you preprocess your variables?
- What neural network architecture did you use?
- Did you try multiple options for the embedding dimension? Did any work better than others? (E.g. plot x = embedding dimension against y = validation accuracy) 
- If your entity embedding dimension was low (1, 2 or 3) can you make a scatterplot of the categories & their learned embeddings?

## The data

Start by reading the [data dictionary](https://vicroadsopendatastorehouse.vicroads.vic.gov.au/opendata/Road_Safety/RCIS%20Documents/Metadata%20-%20Victoria%20Road%20Crash%20data.pdf) for the dataset.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import set_config
from sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler, OrdinalEncoder

set_config(transform_output="pandas")
```

```{python}
df_raw = pd.read_csv("https://laub.au/ai/data/ACCIDENT.csv", low_memory=False)
df_raw
```

## Preprocessing

```{python}
# Drop observations which have categorical variables which are very rare (< 10 obs in the dataset)
# This is a crude solution / surely can be improved.
df_simple = df_raw.copy()

sparse_categories = ["DCA_CODE", "LIGHT_CONDITION", "ROAD_GEOMETRY"]

for cat in sparse_categories:
    df_simple = df_simple[df_simple[cat].map(df_simple[cat].value_counts()) > 10]    

df_simple
```

```{python}
drop = ["ACCIDENT_NO", 'ACCIDENTDATE', 'ACCIDENTTIME', "Accident Type Desc", "Day Week Description", "DCA Description",
        "DIRECTORY", "EDITION", "PAGE", "GRID_REFERENCE_X", "GRID_REFERENCE_Y",
        "Light Condition Desc", "NODE_ID", "Road Geometry Desc"]

df = df_simple.drop(drop, axis=1)

categorical_variables = ["ACCIDENT_TYPE", "DCA_CODE", "LIGHT_CONDITION", "ROAD_GEOMETRY"]
numerical_variables = [col for col in df.columns if col not in categorical_variables]
```

```{python}
print(categorical_variables)
print(numerical_variables)
```

```{python}
# Print the number of unique categories
for cat in categorical_variables:
    print(f"{cat}: {df[cat].nunique()}")
```

```{python}
# Print out the unique values for each categorical variable and their descriptions
categorical_descriptions = ["Accident Type Desc", "DCA Description", "Light Condition Desc", "Road Geometry Desc"]

for cat, desc in zip(categorical_variables, categorical_descriptions):
    df_cat = df_raw[[cat, desc]].drop_duplicates().sort_values(by=[cat]).reset_index(drop=True)
    display(df_cat)
    print()
```

```{python}
target = (df["SEVERITY"] > 2)
features = df.drop("SEVERITY", axis=1)
```
