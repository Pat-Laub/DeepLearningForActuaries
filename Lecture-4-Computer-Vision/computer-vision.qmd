Computer vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on extracting meaningful information from visual data (images and videos). One of the primary goals of computer vision is to correctly identify and classify visual data. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) are the most commonly used neural network architectures for computer vision related tasks.

# Images {visibility="uncounted"}

## Shapes of data

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
A special attention to shapes of data are important in CNN architectures, because CNNs have special types of layers (e.g. convolution and pooling) which require explicit specifications of array dimensions.

## Why is 255 special?

Each pixel's colour intensity is stored in one byte.

One byte is 8 bits, so in binary that is 00000000 to 11111111.

The largest _unsigned_ number this can be is $2^8-1 = 255$.

```{python}
np.array([0, 1, 255, 256]).astype(np.uint8)
```

If you had _signed_ numbers, this would go from -128 to 127.

```{python}
np.array([-128, 1, 127, 128]).astype(np.int8)
```

Alternatively, _hexidecimal_ numbers are used.
E.g. 10100001 is split into 1010 0001, and 1010=A, 0001=1, so combined it is 0xA1.

# Convolutional Layers {visibility="uncounted"}

## 'Convolution' not 'complicated'

Say $X_1, X_2 \sim f_X$ are i.i.d., and we look at $S = X_1 + X_2$.

The density for $S$ is then

$$
f_S(s) = \int_{x_1=-\infty}^{\infty} f_X(x_1) \, f_X(s-x_1) \,\mathrm{d}s .
$$

This is the _convolution_ operation, $f_S = f_X \star f_X$.

## Images are rank 3 tensors

Height, width, and number of channels.

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
An image can be represented using a rank 3 tensor, since it has 3 dimensions; height, width, and number of channels. The number of channels is also known as the 'depth'. The left hand side of the picture shown below is tensor with height =5, width =5 and depth =3.
:::

![Examples of rank 3 tensors.](Glassner/16-1.png)

Grayscale image has 1 channel. RGB image has 3 channels.

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Each colour can be represented as a combination of three primary colours; red, green and blue.
:::

Example: Yellow = Red + Green. 

::: footer

:::

## Example: Detecting yellow

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Suppose we wish to detect if a picture has yellow colour in it. One option would be to apply a neuron over each pixel and see if it detects the colour yellow. We know that each pixel is represented by 3 numerical values that correspond to red, green and blue. Higher numeric values for red and green indicate higher chances of detecting yellow. Higher values for blue indicate lower chances of detecting yellow. Utilising this information, we can assign RGB weights to be 1, 1, -1 respectively. 

Next, a standard multiplication between numeric values and weights is carried out, and the weighted sum is passed through the neuron.

## Example: Detecting yellow II 

![Scan the 3-channel input (colour image) with the neuron to produce a 1-channel output (grayscale image).](Glassner/16-4.png)

The output is produced by *sweeping* the neuron over the input. This is called **convolution**.


::: footer
Source: Glassner (2021), _Deep Learning: A Visual Approach_, Chapter 16.
:::

## Example: Detecting yellow III {data-visibility="uncounted"}

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The following picture demonstrates how yellow-coloured areas (in the colour picture) are transformed into a white colour (in the greyscale picture). This is a result of the way we assigned the weights. Since we assigned +1 weights to red and green, and -1 to blue, it ended up resulting in large positive values (for the weighted sum) for the pixels in the yellow-coloured areas. Large positive values in the greyscale correspond to white colour. Therefore, the areas which were yellow in the colour picture converted to white in the greyscale. In practice, we do not manually assign weights, instead, we let the neural network decide the optimal weights during training.
:::
![The more yellow the pixel in the colour image (left), the more white it is in the grayscale image.](Glassner/16-5.png)

The neuron or its weights is called a **filter**. We *convolve* the image with a filter, i.e. a **convolutional filter**.

## Terminology

- The same neuron is used to sweep over the image, so we can store the weights in some shared memory and process the pixels in parallel. We say that the neurons are *weight sharing*.
- In the previous example, the neuron only takes one pixel as input. Usually a larger filter containing a *block of weights* is used to process not only a pixel but also its neighboring pixels all at once.
- The weights are called the filter **kernels**.
- The cluster of pixels that forms the input of a filter is called its *footprint*.

## Spatial filter

![Example 3x3 filter](Glassner/16-9.png)


When a filter's footprint is > 1 pixel, it is a **spatial filter**.

::: footer
Source: Glassner (2021), _Deep Learning: A Visual Approach_, Chapter 16.
:::

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The above spatial filter is a 3x3 filter. Hence, there are 9 weights to learn. 
:::
## Multidimensional convolution

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
In a multidimensional filter, the number of channels of the input must be equal to the number of channels in the filter (depths must be the same).
:::

Need $\# \text{ Channels in Input} = \# \text{ Channels in Filter}$.

![Example: a 3x3 filter with 3 channels, containing 27 weights.](Glassner/16-18.png)

::: footer
Source: Glassner (2021), _Deep Learning: A Visual Approach_, Chapter 16.
:::

## Example: 3x3 filter over RGB input 

![Each channel is multipled separately & then added together.](Glassner/16-19.png)

::: footer
Source: Glassner (2021), _Deep Learning: A Visual Approach_, Chapter 16.
:::

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The above figure shows how we pick a 3x3x3 block from the image, and then apply the 3x3 filter. The multiplication is carried out channel-wise, i.e. we select the first channel of the filter and the first channel of the image and carry out the element wise multiplation. Once the elementwise multiplications for the three pairs of channels are completed, we sum them all, and pass through the neuron.
:::

## Input-output relationship 

![Matching the original image footprints against the output location.](Glassner/16-10.png)

::: footer
Source: Glassner (2021), _Deep Learning: A Visual Approach_, Chapter 16.
:::

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The above figure shows how 9 inputs transform in to one output. As a result, dimensions of the output matrix is smaller than the dimensions of the input matrix. There are some options we can use if we wish to keep the size of input and output matrices same.
:::

# Convolutional Layer Options {visibility="uncounted"}

## Padding

![What happens when filters go off the edge of the input?](Glassner/16-15.png)
 
 - How to avoid the filter's receptive field falling off the side of the input.
 - If we only scan the filter over places of the input where the filter can fit perfectly, it will lead to loss of information, especially after many filters.
 
::: footer
Source: Glassner (2021), _Deep Learning: A Visual Approach_, Chapter 16.
:::

## Padding

Add a border of extra elements around the input, called **padding**.
Normally we place zeros in all the new elements, called **zero padding**.

![Padded values can be added to the outside of the input.](Glassner/16-17.png)

::: footer
Source: Glassner (2021), _Deep Learning: A Visual Approach_, Chapter 16.
:::

## Convolution layer

- Multiple filters are bundled together in one layer.
- The filters are applied *simultaneously* and *independently* to the input.
- Filters can have different footprints, but in practice we almost always use the same footprint for every filter in a convolution layer.
- Number of channels in the output will be the same as the number of filters.

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The motivation behind applying filters *simultaneously* and *independently* is to let the filters learn different patterns in the input-output relationship. The idea is quite similar to using many neurons in one `Dense` layer (in a `Dense` layer, we would use multiple neurons so that different neurons can capture different patterns in the input-output relationship).
:::

## Example

::: columns
::: column
In the image:

- 6-channel input tensor
- input pixels
- four 3x3 filters
- four output tensors
- final output tensor.

::: footer

:::

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The above picture shows how we take in an image with 6 channels, select a 3x3 block (in pink colour), apply 4 different filters of same dimensions (in pink, green, blue and yellow), retrieve the output with 1 channel (1 output for each filter) and finally stack them together to create 1 output tensor. Note that the number of channels in the output tensor is 4, which is equal to the number of spatial filters used.  
:::


## 1x1 convolution

- Feature reduction: Reduce the number of channels in the input tensor (removing correlated features) by using fewer filters than the number of channels in the input. This is because the number of channels in the output is always the same as number of filters.
- 1x1 convolution: Convolution using 1x1 filters. 
- When the channels are correlated, 1x1 convolution is very effective at reducing channels without loss of information.

## Example of 1x1 convolution {.smaller}

![Example network with 1x1 convolution.](Glassner/16-23.png)

- Input tensor contains 300 channels.
- Use 175 1x1 filters in the convolution layer (300 weights each).
- Each filter produces a 1-channel output.
- Final output tensor has 175 channels.

::: footer
Source: Glassner (2021), _Deep Learning: A Visual Approach_, Chapter 16.
:::

## Striding

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Striding options allows to modify the movement of the filter across the image. Instead moving one step at a time (either horizontally or vertically), we can increase the number of steps using the *striding* option.
:::

We don't have to go one pixel across/down at a time.

![Example: Use a stride of three horizontally and two vertically.](Glassner/16-29.png)

Dimension of output will be smaller than input.

::: footer

:::

## Choosing strides {.smaller}

::: {layout-ncol=2}
![](Glassner/16-31.png)

![](Glassner/16-32.png)
:::

When a filter scans the input step by step, it processes the same input elements multiple times. Even with larger strides, this can still happen (left image).

**If** we want to save time, we can choose strides that prevents input elements from being used more than once. Example (right image): 3x3 filter, stride 3 in both directions.

::: footer
Source: Glassner (2021), _Deep Learning: A Visual Approach_, Chapter 16.
:::

## Specifying a convolutional layer

Need to choose:

- number of filters,
- their footprints (e.g. 3x3, 5x5, etc.),
- activation functions,
- padding & striding (optional).

All the filter weights are learned during training.

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
A standard CNN architecture has the following components: an input layer, a sequence of feature extraction layers (which combine convolution and pooling operations sequentially), a sequence of classification layers (which include flattening and fully connected layers) and a final output layer. Convolution layers are used to extract meaningful patterns from the input using spatial filters. Pooling layers are used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps generated from convolutional layers. The purpose of the feature extraction layers is to learn complex but meaningful, high levels patterns in data. The aim of classification layers is to receive the learned patterns and make decisions more closely related to the classification task at hand.

:::

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
On a high level, the idea would be to keep on increasing the number of channels (depth) and decrease the dimensions of the feature map. We can see how the depth increases, and spatial dimensions reduce from first convolution layer to the second pooling layer.
:::

## Pooling

**Pooling**, or **downsampling**, is a technique to blur a tensor.

- Input tensor: 6x6 with 1 channel, zero padding.
- Convolution layer: Three 3x3 filters.
- Convolution layer output: 6x6 with 3 channels.
- Pooling layer: apply max pooling to each channel.
- Pooling layer output: 3x3, 3 channels.

## Why/why not use pooling?

**Why?** Pooling *reduces the size* of tensors, therefore reduces memory usage and execution time (recall that 1x1 convolution *reduces the number of channels* in a tensor).

**Why not?**

# Fitting a (multinomial) logistic regression


## Make a logistic regression

![Basically pretend it's not an image](flattening-image-to-vector.png)

```{python}
from keras.layers import Rescaling, Flatten     #<1>

num_classes = np.unique(y_train).shape[0]       #<2>
random.seed(123)
model = Sequential([
  Input((img_height, img_width, 1)), Flatten(), Rescaling(1./255),
  Dense(num_classes, activation="softmax")
])
```
1. Imports preprocessing layers from `keras.layers` useful for image data
2. Specifies the number of unique categories in the train set

::: {.callout-tip}
The `Rescaling` layer will rescale the intensities to [0, 1].

Most of this last part is just to save time rendering this slides, you don't need it.

## Plot the loss/accuracy curves

# Fitting a CNN {visibility="uncounted"}

## Make a CNN

```{python}
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D                          #<1>

random.seed(123)

model = Sequential([
  Input((img_height, img_width, 1)),
  Rescaling(1./255),                                                    #<2>
  Conv2D(16, 3, padding="same", activation="relu", name="conv1"),       #<3>
  MaxPooling2D(name="pool1"),                                           #<4>
  Conv2D(32, 3, padding="same", activation="relu", name="conv2"),
  MaxPooling2D(name="pool2"),
  Conv2D(64, 3, padding="same", activation="relu", name="conv3"),
  MaxPooling2D(name="pool3", pool_size=(4, 4)),
  Flatten(), Dense(64, activation="relu"), Dense(num_classes)           #<5>
])
```
1. Imports CNN specific preprocessing layers from `keras.layers`
2. Rescales the numeric representations of data which ranges from [0,255] in to [0, 1] range
3. Applies the convolution layer. Here `padding="same"` ensures that the dimensions of the input and output matrices remain same
4. Applies `MaxPooling`, which reduces the spatial dimensions by carrying forward the maximum value over an input window
5. Applies the `Flatten` layer to convert the 2D array (from pooling) in to a single column vector, and passes through couple of `Dense` layers to train the neural network for the specific classification problem.
Note that the output layer has number of neurons equal to `num_classes`, which corresponds to the number of unique classes in the output.

    history = hist.history
    with open("cnn_history.json", "w") as json_file:
        json.dump(history, json_file)
```

1. Defines the loss function with an added command `from_logits=True`. Doing this instead of defining a `softmax` function at the output `Dense` layer of the neural network is expected to be more numerically stable
2. Specifies a new metric to keep track of accuracy of the top 5 predicted classes. This means that, for each input image, the metric will consider whether the true class is among the top 5 predicted classes by the model
3. Compiles the model as usual with an optimizer, a loss function and metrics to monitor

::: {.callout-tip}
Instead of using softmax activation, just added `from_logits=True` to the loss function; this is more numerically stable.

## How does that work?

> ... these models use a technique called transfer learning. There’s a pretrained neural network, and when you create your own classes, you can sort of picture that your classes are becoming the last layer or step of the neural net. Specifically, both the image and pose models are learning off of pretrained mobilenet models ...

## Transfer learning

```python
# Pull in the base model we are transferring from.
base_model = keras.applications.Xception(
    weights='imagenet',  # Load weights pre-trained on ImageNet.
    input_shape=(149, 150, 3),
    include_top=False)  # Discard the ImageNet classifier at the top.

# Tell it not to update its weights.
base_model.trainable = False

# Make our new model on top of the base model.
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(149, 150, 3))
x = base_model(inputs, training=False)
x = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(x)
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(0)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)

# Compile and fit on our data.
model.compile(optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(),
              loss=keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=[keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy()])
model.fit(new_dataset, epochs=19, callbacks=..., validation_data=...)
```

## Fine-tuning

```python
# Unfreeze the base model
base_model.trainable = True

# It's important to recompile your model after you make any changes
# to the `trainable` attribute of any inner layer, so that your changes
# are take into account
model.compile(
    optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(0e-5),  # Very low learning rate
    loss=keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
    metrics=[keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy()])

# Train end-to-end. Be careful to stop before you overfit!
model.fit(new_dataset, epochs=9, callbacks=..., validation_data=...)
```

::: {.callout-caution}
Keep the learning rate low, otherwise you may accidentally throw away the useful information in the base model.
