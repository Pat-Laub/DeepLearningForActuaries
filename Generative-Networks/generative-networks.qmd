# Text Generation {visibility="uncounted"}

## Generative deep learning

- Using AI as augmented intelligence rather than artificial intelligence.
- Use of deep learning to augment creative activities such as writing, music and art, to *generate* new things.
- Some applications: text generation, deep dreaming, neural style transfer, variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks.

## Text generation

> Generating sequential data is the closest computers get to dreaming.

- Generate sequence data: Train a model to predict the next token or next few tokens in a sentence, using previous tokens as input.
- A network that models the probability of the next tokens given the previous ones is called a *language model*.

::: {.notes}
GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter text-generation model trained by the startup OpenAI on a large text corpus of digitally available books, Wikipedia and web crawling. GPT-3 made headlines in 2020 due to its capability to generate plausible-sounding text paragraphs on virtually any topic.

:::

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The way how word-level language models work is that, it first takes in the input text and then generates the probability distribution of the next word. This distribution tells us how likely a certain word is to be the next word. Thereafter, the model implements a appropriate sampling strategy to select the next word. Once the next word is predicted, it is appended to the input text and then passed in to the model again to predict the next word. The idea here is to predict the word after word.

# Sampling strategy

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The sampling strategy refers to the way how we pick the next word/character as the prediction after observing the distribution. There are different sampling strategies and they aim to serve different levels of trade-offs between exploration and exploitation when generating text sequences. 
:::

- *Greedy sampling* will choose the token with the highest probability. It makes the resulting sentence repetitive and predictable.
- *Stochastic sampling*: if a word has probability 0.3 of being next in the sentence according to the model, we’ll choose it 30% of the time. But the result is still not interesting enough and still quite predictable.
- Use a *softmax temperature* to control the randomness. More randomness results in more surprising and creative sentences.

## Softmax temperature

- The softmax temperature is a parameter that controls the randomness of the next token.
- The formula is: $$ \text{softmax}_\text{temperature}(x) = \frac{\exp(x / \text{temperature})}{\sum_i \exp(x_i / \text{temperature})} $$

## "I am a" ...

```{python}
#| echo: false
def softmax(x, temperature=1.0):
    return np.exp(x / temperature) / np.sum(np.exp(x / temperature))

x = np.array([0.15, 0.5, 0.1, 0.25])
x /= np.sum(x)

# Plot bar charts for the original distributions and the softmax temperature versions.
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 3))

phrase = "I am a"
next_words = ["dog", "human", "robot", "teddy"] 

plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
temperature = 0.1
plt.bar(next_words, softmax(x, temperature), color=colors)
plt.title(f"Temp = {temperature}")

plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
temperature = 1
plt.bar(next_words, softmax(x, temperature), color=colors)
plt.title(f"Temp = {temperature}")

temperature = 10
plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
plt.bar(next_words, softmax(x, temperature), color=colors)
plt.title(f"Temp = {temperature}")

plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
temperature = 100
plt.bar(next_words, softmax(x, temperature), color=colors)
plt.title(f"Temp = {temperature}")

# Clean up the layout.
plt.tight_layout()

plt.show()
```

:::

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The graphical illustration above shows how the distribution of words change with different levels of `Temp` values. Higher levels of temperatures result in less predictable(more interesting) outcomes. If we continue to increase the `Temp` levels, after a certain point, outcomes will be picked completely at random. This predictions after this point might not be meaningful. Hence, attention to the trade-off between predictability and interestingness is important when deciding the `Temp` levels.
:::


::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The following sections show how a neural network turned on the same dataset, and given the same starting input string _In today's lecture we will_ shall generate very different sequences of text as predictions. `Temp=0.25` may give interesting outputs compared to `Temp=0.01` and `Temp=0.50` may give interesting outputs compared to `Temp=0.25`. However, when we keep on increasing `Temp` levels, the neural network starts giving out random(meaningless) outcomes.

## Generate the most likely sequence

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Similar to other sequence generating tasks such as generating the next word or generating the next character, generating an entire sequence of words is also useful. The task involves generating the most likely sequence after observing model predictions.

## Beam search

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Instead of trying to carry forward only the highest probable prediction, beam search carries forward several high probable predictions, and then decide the highest probable combination of predictions. Beam search helps expand the exploration horizon for predictions which can contribute to more contextually relevant model predictions. However, this comes at a certain computational complexity.

# Image Generation {visibility="uncounted"}

## Reverse-engineering a CNN

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Reverse engineering is a process where we manipulate the inputs _x_ while keeping the loss function and the model architecture the same. This is useful in understanding the inner workings of the model, especially when we do not have access to the model architecture or the original train dataset. The idea here is to tweak/distort the input feature data and observe how model predictions vary. This provides meaningful insights in to what patterns in the input data are most critical to making model predictions. 
:::

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
This task however requires computing the gradients of the model's outputs with respect to all input features, hence, can be time consuming. 
:::

A CNN is a function $f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})$ that takes a vector (image) $\mathbf{x}$ and returns a vector (distribution) $\widehat{\mathbf{y}}$.

Normally, we train it by modifying $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ so that 

$$ \boldsymbol{\theta}^*\ =\  \underset{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\mathrm{argmin}} \,\, \text{Loss} \bigl( f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{y} \bigr). $$

However, it is possible to _not train_ the network but to modify $\mathbf{x}$, like

$$ \mathbf{x}^*\ =\  \underset{\mathbf{x}}{\mathrm{argmin}} \,\, \text{Loss} \bigl( f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{y} \bigr). $$

This is very slow as we do gradient descent every single time.

## Adversarial examples

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
An adversarial attack refers to a small carefully created modifications to the input data that aims to trick the model in to making wrong predictions while keeping the _y_true_ same. The goal is to identify instances where subtle modifications in the input data (which are not instantaneously recognized) can lead to erroneous model predictions.

The above example shows how a small perturbation to the image of a panda led to the model predicting the image as a gibbon with high confidence. This indicates that there may be certain patterns in the data which are not clearly seen by the human eye, but the model is relying on them to make predictions. Identifying these sensitivities/vulnerabilities are important to understand how a model is making its predictions.

## DeepDream

- Even though many deep learning models are black boxes, convnets are quite interpretable via visualization. Some visualization techniques are: visualizing convnet outputs shows how convnet layers transform the input, visualizing convnet filters shows what visual patterns or concept each filter is receptive to, etc.
- The activations of the first few layers of the network carries more information about the visual contents, while deeper layers encode higher, more abstract concepts.

## DeepDream

- Each filter is receptive to a visual pattern. To visualize a convnet filter, gradient ascent is used to maximize the response of the filter. Gradient ascent maximize a loss function and moves the image in a direction that activate the filter more strongly to enhance its reading of the visual pattern. 
- DeepDream maximizes the activation of the entire convnet layer rather than that of a specific filter, thus mixing together many visual patterns all at once.
- DeepDream starts with an existing image, latches on to preexisting visual patterns, distorting elements of the image in a somewhat artistic fashion.

## Goal of NST

What the model does:

- Preserve content by maintaining similar deeper layer activations between the original image and the generated image. The convnet should “see” both the original image and the generated image as containing the same things.

- Preserve style by maintaining similar correlations within activations for both low level layers and high-level layers. Feature correlations within a layer capture textures: the generated image and the style-reference image should share the same textures at different spatial scales.

# Autoencoders {visibility="uncounted"}


## Autoencoder

An autoencoder takes a data/image, maps it to a latent space via an encoder module, then decodes it back to an output with the same dimensions via a decoder module.

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
They are useful in learning latent representations of the data.
:::

![Schematic of an autoencoder.](autoencoder.png)

::: footer
Source: Marcus Lautier (2022).
:::

## Autoencoder II {.smaller}

- An autoencoder is trained by using the same image as both the input and the target, meaning an autoencoder learns to reconstruct the original inputs. Therefore it's _not supervised learning_, but _self-supervised learning_.
- If we impose constraints on the encoders to be low-dimensional and sparse, _the input data will be compressed_ into fewer bits of information. 
- Latent space is a place that stores low-dimensional representation of data. It can be used for _data compression_, where data is compressed to a point in a latent space.
- An image can be compressed into a latent representation, which can then be reconstructed back to a _slightly different image_. 

::: {.notes}
For image editing, an image can be projected onto a latent space and moved inside the latent space in a meaningful way (which means we modify its latent representation), before being mapped back to the image space. This will edit the image and allow us to generate images that have never been seen before.
:::

{{< include _psam-gan.qmd >}}

{{< include _variational-autoencoder.qmd >}}

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Both autoencoders and variational autoencoders aim to obtain latent representations of input data that carry same information but in a lower dimensional space. The difference between the two is that, autoencoders outputs the latent representations as vectors, while variational auto encoders first identifies the distribution of the input in the latent space, and then sample an observation from that as the vector. Autoencoders are better suited for dimensionality reduction and feature learning tasks. Variation autoencoders are better suited for generative modelling tasks and uncertainty estimation.
