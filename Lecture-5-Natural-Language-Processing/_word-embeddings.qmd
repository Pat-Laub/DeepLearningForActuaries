# Word Embeddings {visibility="uncounted"}

## Overview

::: {.notes}
In order for deep learning models to process language, we need to supply that language to the model in a way it can digest, i.e. a __quantitative representation__ such as a 2-D matrix of numerical values.

## Word Vectors

- One-hot representations capture word 'existence' only, whereas word vectors capture information about word meaning as well as location.
- This enables deep learning NLP models to automatically learn linguistic features.
- **Word2Vec** & **GloVe** are popular algorithms for generating word embeddings (i.e. word vectors).

## Word Vectors

![Illustrative word vectors.](krohn_f02_06.jpeg)

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Word vectors are a type of word embedding which can return numerical representations of words in a continuous vector space. There representations capture semantic knowledge of the words. For example, we can see how days are positioned closer to each other in a _n_-dimensional space.
:::



::: {.notes}
- Overarching concept is to assign each word within a corpus to a particular, meaningful location within a multidimensional space called the vector space.
- Initially each word is assigned to a random location.
- BUT by considering the words that tend to be used around a given word within the corpus, the locations of the words shift.

Embeddings are numerical representations of categorical data that were learned during the supervised learning process. However, numerical representations like **Word2Vec** & **GloVe** are popular algorithms for generating word embeddings that were trained by others, i.e. they are pretrained.

## Word2Vec

**Key idea**: You're known by the company you keep.

Two algorithms are used to calculate embeddings:

* _Continuous bag of words_: uses the context words to predict the target word
* _Skip-gram_: uses the target word to predict the context words

Predictions are made using a neural network with one hidden layer. Through backpropagation, we update a set of "weights" which become the word vectors.

## Word Vector Arithmetic

Relationships between words becomes vector math.

![You remember vectors, right?](vectors-Figure_03_02_09.jpeg)

::: {.notes}
- E.g., if we calculate the direction and distance between the coordinates of the words _Paris_ and _France_, and trace this direction and distance from _London_, we should be close to the word _England_.

# 

<h2>Pretrained word embeddings</h2>

```{python}
#| output: false
!pip install gensim                                 #<1>
```
1. Imports the `gensim` library. This is a popular library for document analysis

Load word2vec embeddings trained on Google News:
```{python}
import gensim.downloader as api                    #<1>
wv = api.load('word2vec-google-news-300')          #<2>
```
1. Imports the `gensim.downloader` module from the `gensim` library and stores is as `api`. This module contains pretrained models including **Word2Vec** and **GloVe** that can be used for NLP tasks
2. Loads the **Word2Vec** from the `word2vec-google-news-300` dataset and stores is as `wv`

When run for the first time, that downloads a huge file:

```{python}
gensim_dir = Path("~/gensim-data/").expanduser()
[str(p) for p in gensim_dir.iterdir()]
```

```{python}
next(gensim_dir.glob("*/*.gz")).stat().st_size / 1024**3
```

```{python}
f"The size of the vocabulary is {len(wv)}"
```

## Treat `wv` like a dictionary

```{python}
wv["pizza"]
```

```{python}
len(wv["pizza"])
```

## Find nearby word vectors 

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
With `wv`, we can find words similar for a given word, or compute the similarity between two words.
:::

```{python}
wv.most_similar("Python")
```

```{python}
wv.similarity("Python", "Java")
```

```{python}
wv.similarity("Python", "sport")
```

```{python}
wv.similarity("Python", "R")
```

::: footer
Fun fact: Gensim's `most_similar` uses Spotify's `annoy` library ("Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah")
:::

## What does 'similarity' mean?

The 'similarity' scores
```{python}
wv.similarity("Sydney", "Melbourne")
```

are normally based on cosine distance.
```{python}
x = wv["Sydney"]
y = wv["Melbourne"]
x.dot(y) / (np.linalg.norm(x) * np.linalg.norm(y))
```

```{python}
wv.similarity("Sydney", "Aarhus")
```

## Combining word vectors

You can summarise a sentence by averaging the individual word vectors.

```{python}
sv = (wv["Melbourne"] + wv["has"] + wv["better"] + wv["coffee"]) / 4
len(sv), sv[:5]
```

> As it turns out, averaging word embeddings is a surprisingly effective way to create word embeddings. It’s not perfect (as you’ll see), but it does a strong job of capturing what you might perceive to be complex relationships between words.

## Analogies with word vectors

Obama is to America as ___ is to Australia.

::: fragment
$$ \text{Obama} - \text{America} + \text{Australia} = ? $$
:::

::: fragment
```{python}
wv.most_similar(positive=["Obama", "Australia"], negative=["America"])
```
:::

## Testing more associations 

```{python}
wv.most_similar(positive=["France", "London"], negative=["Paris"])
```

## Quickly get to bad associations

```{python}
wv.most_similar(positive=["King", "woman"], negative=["man"])
```

```{python}
wv.most_similar(positive=["computer_programmer", "woman"], negative=["man"])
```

The Verge (2016), [Twitter taught Microsoft's AI chatbot to be a racist a****** in less than a day](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist).
:::
::: column
> ... there are serious questions to answer, like how are we going to teach AI using public data without incorporating the worst traits of humanity? If we create bots that mirror their users, do we care if their users are human trash? There are plenty of examples of technology embodying — either accidentally or on purpose — the prejudices of society, and Tay's adventures on Twitter show that even big corporations like Microsoft forget to take any preventative measures against these problems.
:::
:::

## The library cheats a little bit

```{python}
wv.similar_by_vector(wv["computer_programmer"]-wv["man"]+wv["woman"])
```

To get the 'nice' analogies, the `.most_similar` ignores the input words as possible answers.

```{python}
#| eval: false
# ignore (don't return) keys from the input
result = [
    (self.index_to_key[sim + clip_start], float(dists[sim]))
    for sim in best if (sim + clip_start) not in all_keys
]
```
